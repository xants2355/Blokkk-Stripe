# Blokkk-Stripe
Block stripe font mainly for UX and UI. Glyphs widths are based on identical characters from Raleway, same x-height. The overall feeling is more organic, compare to existing block fonts and a bit wider compare to "normal" sans serif fonts.

I'm still not sure about x-height, I'll test it how it works in real enviroment.
